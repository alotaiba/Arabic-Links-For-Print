Arabic Links for Print, is a jQuery plugin, that improves the printed Arabic web pages, by collecting all the links found on the page, and placing them on the bottom of the page, a.k.a footnote.

This plugin was highly inspired by the work of Aaron Gustafson on [A List Apart][1].

You can take a look at the supplied "example" folder, to see how this plugin works.

For more details, I've written an [article on qatardr.net][2], explaining the details of this plugin.
